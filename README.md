## üöÄGetting Started

### üîßInstall

Let's start with the following command:
Install the dependencies:

```

### üîçDetect a account 

The project will collect transaction data and account information from the designated account

If you want to collect data on this account "8KNu2J8gk4ZCGdpA2vPbcuKmRyc7R6qSCRPaycbCaia7"

Run on this command as follow:

```shell
scrapy crawl  solana.etl -a account_key=8KNu2J8gk4ZCGdpA2vPbcuKmRyc7R6qSCRPaycbCaia7 -a providers=https://few-morning-waterfall.solana-mainnet.quiknode.pro/12d6f7012c975de42801cbfbb5494b9eafa8e281,https://magical-greatest-haze.solana-mainnet.quiknode.pro/e9bc0e26c5cd1d10024e93933ec7b8d24467773c
